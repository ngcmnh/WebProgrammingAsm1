# WebProgrammingAsm1

First Test of Web Programming Course

Description: For clarification, I only did 1 book details page among the few books shown in the home and category page. So, in total, I completed 4 html files (1 main, 1 category page, 1 book details page, 1 contact page) and 3 css files. For live hosting, I chose Netlify to host the website.
